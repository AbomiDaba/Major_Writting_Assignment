                    Systemic inequality has plagued our country since any one can remember. 
                    It is like a cancer that has to be weeded out. This concept tells people 
                    they are not good enough or born the right way to the point they can not get
                    what is due to them because they are not like the majority. So, this 
                    exhibition will deal with different types of systemic issues that people 
                    deal with primarily in the Unites States. I present artists with different 
                    backgrounds to express their ideas and solutions to problems with inequality.

                    The artists I have chosen in my exhibition all have unique approaches and 
                    styles of art, yet they have the same end goal; creating a better tomorrow 
                    for all people. With the United States continually becoming more and more 
                    diverse, especially compared to its inception, the idea of a fairer society 
                    is imperative to living in a more fulfilling and free country. I present a 
                    wide spectrum of injustices that continue to rear its ugly head into our 
                    nation. From health care, gender, race, equity, voting, and so on we’ll deal 
                    with how these different issues can be protested and dealt with, even with 
                    just art. Protesting and doing your part may look different, maybe even 
                    unorthodox, but any effort is a step closer to a better tomorrow for all people.

                    This is very important to address because with diversity increasing in so 
                    many ways, we have to continue the fight for equality. Some may think because 
                    we’ve come so far that we don’t have to be as active in making changes for the better. 
                    Or even the only way to make a change is to be a politician, but that couldn’t be further 
                    from the truth. Some may think art is just a talent or skill used for entertainment. 
                    Well, these artists I have here will debunk that faulty ideology and hopefully show how 
                    versatile methods to making a difference can be. Some of these artists grew up in third world 
                    countries in impoverished environments yet used are to make actual changes in societies 
                    such as Edwardo Kobra and Ben Shahn just to name a couple. So my hope is to encourage my 
                    audience to keep the fight alive and find ways in which you can contribute to continuing 
                    the effort for a more equal country for all.
