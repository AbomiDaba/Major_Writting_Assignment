                    My choice of form impacted my goal in a very positive way. I believe that in 
                    order to show that art can be used in way to protest and make societal changes, 
                    the best way would be to share those images with explanations for context. So, 
                    with that being said, having an exhibition seemed to be the best way to get that 
                    done. This form allowed me to have a plethora of art pieces to show and make my 
                    connections in relation to my argument. The down side to an exhibition is that 
                    my explanations are limited when at times more said may be necessary.

                    I actually had a lot of changes from the beginning stages of this major writing 
                    assignment to this final piece. Originally, I planned to focus either on the Harlem 
                    Renaissance or police brutality. As I was researching my inquiring questions I 
                    realized there wasn’t much information that I could glean from, at least to where I
                    would be satisfied. I continued my research and came across a reoccurring theme 
                    which is art addressing systemic injustices. That topic caught my interest as I 
                    continued to research, and I decided to go with that theme which worked out well for me.

                    Unfortunately we don’t hear the impact that art makes in so many sectors of 
                    life. We think that art is just for entertainment purposes, which part of 
                    that is true but I realized how there have been so many impactful and 
                    important artists that makes their purpose in their art to make a statement 
                    that will improve society. This really gave me a sense of confidence in my 
                    argument because I already knew this method that is employed by artists is 
                    effective, but I never realized how much it truly impacted different parts 
                    of society, even in different parts of the world.

                    I am most satisfied with the range of inequalities I addressed. I tried to 
                    make sure I presented different kinds of issues that different minorities 
                    face, so having versatility in issues gave me a sense of satisfaction. This 
                    works well because, first off, systemic inequality has diversity. So, 
                    addressing the different kinds of injustices and seeing them addressed 
                    through art makes this major writing assignment more appealing to my audience 
                    I believe. The only thing I would really apply would be the research aspect of 
                    this class because the reality is in almost everything you do professionally 
                    requires some kind of research.

                    As far as the content of my major writing assignment, I don’t think I would 
                    change much of what I have besides maybe adding a couple more images of art 
                    that address more kinds of systemic injustices. Other than that, what I 
                    would do differently if I had more time would be making my web page more 
                    appealing. I didn’t have as much time as I thought and came across a couple 
                    technical problems. In the end I just had to make something sufficient to 
                    host my project.
