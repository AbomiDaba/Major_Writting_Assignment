She made this to show and give a visual aid based on statistics to show how the negative space between America’s richest folks whose wealth has increased exponentially and even surpassed the growth rate of our economy and the remaining 90% of Americans whose income has grown slower than our economy.

                    Justine Swindell is an artist based In Washington D.C. She collaborates with brands, organizations, and businesses to develop depictions of people and communities. She has a bachelor’s degree in business management with a concentration in Design and an M.A. in Sociology. This was made in 2021. This art piece is supposed to depict the collaboration it takes across policymakers, institutions, and individuals to close the racial wealth gap. She has symbolic references such as a nod to the many pins and bumper stickers that surface during social movements. The background is a black and white divide with an all-American denim on both sides. The pins and matches on the denim are to represent the solutions that can be employed to this systemic problem. The closing of the jacket is to represent the ‘possibility of a better future’ as Justine Swindell put it.

                    - Barbara Kruger is an artist from Newark, New Jersey. She has been putting artwork since the 1970’s in art galleries. In 1976 she quit creating art because she felt her art work lacked meaning. She started again in 1977 to make art but instead of her style being photo and text collages  and developed her signature style using large-scale black-and-white images overlaid with text. Kruger normally addresses media and politics. In this art piece was created in 1989. She created during the 1989 march for women’s equality and women lives. In the image she has a women’s face split in positive and negative light. This is her protest to fight women inequality at that time.

In this photograph she is addressing issues in flint Michigan with toxic water. She wrote a book called flint is family where she used these photos to give a visual picture of flint water plant. Michigan town’s water supply was still tainted by deadly bacteria and lead, forcing residents to buy bottled water when it should have been safely available in their homes. Frazier’s photo essay on Flint first ran in Elle magazine. She then exhibited the images at the gallery Gavin Brown’s Enterprise in 2018.

                    In 2021, The Commonwealth Fund wrote an article called ‘Confronting Racism in Health Care’. They used Jude Marks and other local artist of color to illustrate some of the reported incidents of racism. This picture here was done by Jude marks, (unfortunately not much information about him is known) and was posted on an Instagram through which users can scroll and leave comments. The goal was to spark dialogue about how best to respond to incidents like these. This illustration is supposed to convey the judgment of staff who couldn’t reach the mother of an emergency department patient in the middle of the night. Rather than assume she was sleeping, a member of the care team suggested she was just trying to get rid of her son.

                    Mia Saine is a queer African American illustrator and designer from Memphis, Tennessee. Mia enjoys sharing real narratives about marginalized people while creating flat, vibrant illustrations. She specializes in branding and editorial illustration while also working within various print and digital mediums to celebrate diversity and community. She creates imagery and storytelling that encourages a digestible approach to communicating dire issues with others. In this artwork Mia Saine addresses inequality regarding equity. Mia says ‘Equity can be configured when accessibility is finally given. People have the human right to obtain and experience the freedom they have been promised. Accessibility dismantles the pillars that barricade our communities from experiencing progression and healing. Beyond the endless cycle of disconnection, people can finally see their lives at true value and being to see community’s flourish. This change would offer us the opportunity to build various aspirations and resources to secure a sturdier foundation for everyone.’ The picture shows different kinds of minorities reaping the benefits of equity.

A lot of her art focuses on social justice, and Nadia hopes to encourage people to find their voice and show up for others. This piece was created in 2021. Nadia wanted to address voting rights in America. She wants this art piece to help protect voting rights for all people. She says ‘in order to fight democracy and equity, we have to protect voting rights’. She describes the stars as representation of the United States since they were at the time passing laws at an alarming rate to suppress voting rights, in her explanation on the ACLU web page displaying her art piece. The flag is supposed to represent the rights that we are trying to protect and expand.

                <p>
                    Ben studied at New York University, the City College of New York, and the National Academy of Design. Sharing a studio in 1929 with the photographer Walker Evans stimulated Shahn's own interest in photography; he began photographing people and street scenes, first in New York and later around the country. Ben Shahn's art deals with protest injustice and prejudice. His paintings and prints address social and political issues, focusing on the poor and disenfranchised. This painting called prenatal clinic was done in 1941. The two women here are looking in different directions. They are separated and lonely, sitting in a cold and dark-looking waiting room and seem tired of waiting for someone to arrive and help them. Shahn’s statement on the wall, “Do I Deserve Prenatal Care,” shows his sympathy for the women and his protest the situation in which so many others find themselves. The work is a fight for more appropriate care in prenatal care.

                    Tatyana is a visual artist focusing on oil painting, murals, and multimedia installation. Her work is mostly about the experiences of Black folks, women, and queer folks. This poster she created was in 2012. The message is about a type of gender injustice women face regularly which is street harassment. The series, called Stop Telling Women to Smile referring to a common catcall, started in the fall of 2012 and is ongoing by her. The posters show the portraits of women, with a quote telling their experiences with street harassment. Tatyana’s goal is that the captions speak directly to offenders by placing the posters outside in public spaces where harassment happens.

                    Eduardo Kobra from Sao Paulo has become one of the most recognized muralists today, with works on 5 continents.  He holds the record for the largest graffiti mural in the world. Created for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, this mural depicts five Indigenous people from five continents -- a concept based on the five Olympic rings. The bold, geometric mural is meant to show how "we are all connected.” This portrays that through our connection we should treat everybody equally and fight the idea of any inequality based off of color of ones skin. This shows unity and equality for all.
